# R Package Listing for Visual Studio Code

Placeholder for a VS Code extension listing R packages installed in your R
package library/libraries.

Principally intended as an extension for [Positron](https://positron.posit.co)
to provide some of the functionality of the
[Packages tab](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/ui-panes.html#packages)
in the RStudio IDE.

## Features

Current intention is a new primary sidebar view that provides a tree-list view
of installed R packages, with minimal details such as version and description.

Maybe replicate functionality to navigate to a package's help manual.
